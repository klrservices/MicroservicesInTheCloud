# Creating a simple REST microservice

This tutorial shows how to implement a simple REST based microservice using Groovy, Spark Java and Gradle. The application we create can be later on uploaded to the Oracle Developer Cloud Service and a job can be created to automatically build and deploy the package to the Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.
We start with the basics - let's create a traditional "Hello World" application using technologies mentioned before: Groovy, Spark Java framework and Gradle as a build tool. As an IDE we will use NetBeans 8.2 with a Groovy plugin installed.

### Creating Hello World application in Groovy and Spark
Open NetBeans and create a new project:

![New project][groovy__new_project_1]

Choose **Gradle** Category and **Single Gradle Project**
